# 8.2 - Add Some Logic
# Solutions to review exercises

# Exercise 1
# Test whether these expressions are True or False
print((1 <= 1) and (1 != 1))
print(not (1 != 2))
print(("good" != "bad") or False)
print(("good" != "Good") and not (1 == 1))

# Exercise 2
# Add parentheses so that the following expressions all
# evaluate to True

# False == not True
print(False == (not True))
# True and False == True and False
print((True and False) == (True and False))
# not True and "A" == "B"
print(not (True and "A" == "B"))
